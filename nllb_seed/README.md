# No Language Left Behind Seed Data 

NLLB Seed is a set of professionally-translated sentences in the Wikipedia domain. Data for NLLB-Seed was sampled from Wikimedia’s [List of articles every Wikipedia should have](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Expanded), a collection of topics in different fields of knowledge and human activity. NLLB-Seed consists of around six thousand sentences in 39 languages. NLLB-Seed is meant to be used for training rather than model evaluation. Due to this difference, NLLB-Seed does not go through the human quality assurance process present in FLORES-200.
